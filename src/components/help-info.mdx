This app allows you to make Google Calendar events more quickly by parsing a simple shorthand notation that looks like this:

```
t, d, 2d, 3w buy some bananas
```

This will create the same event today (`t`), in one day (`d`), in two days (`2d`) and in three weeks (`3w`).

But before the event is created, it enters a review area where you can decide whether you want to send it to calendar or delete it.

After inputting your event notation, you can press enter to start adding additional events to the review area.

Also, you can re-add past events to your review area by clicking on them.
