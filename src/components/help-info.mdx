import { Heading } from "rebass";

This app allows you to make Google Calendar events more quickly by parsing a simple shorthand notation that looks like this:

```
t, d, 2d, 3w buy some bananas
```

This will create the same event today (`t`), in one day (`d`), in two days (`2d`) and in three weeks (`3w`). But it won't create the event yet, it will add it to the review area.

You can now press the enter key if you want to add additional events.

In the review area, you can choose to delete or send events. Just note that it will send to the calendar defined in the environment file, not your personal calendar (for security reasons).

You can also re-add past events to your review area by clicking on them.
